The Bubble Keyboard is a new keyboard designed by us with the specific intention of using these gesture based systems and prediction algorithms to minimize motion and increase speed, in contrast to a model of the industry standard.

The Bubble Keyboard consists of two concentric rings of letters from a center point where the outer ring is a static representation of the entire alphabet and the inner is a variable representation of the most probable letters. Selection of letters is done by passing the cursor, which is controlled by the user’s hand, over the desired bubble in a wave rather than placing the cursor over the letter and making a selection gesture as done in the industry model. Other functions, such as Backspace and Shift, are done through gestures rather than button selection.

Selection of letters in the Bubble Keyboard is simple: Simply move the pointer over the bubble (in either ring) that corresponds to your desired choice and then bring your hand back to the center circle. This completes a selection.

The testing will be conducted by asking you to type a series of sentences as prompted by a program. When you are done typing the sentence, the tester will refresh the sentence displayed. Simply continue until testing is complete.
